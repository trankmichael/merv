Divisi2 is a library for reasoning by analogy and association over
semantic networks, including common sense knowledge. Divisi uses a
sparse higher-order SVD and can help find related concepts, features,
and relation types in any knowledge base that can be represented as a
semantic network. By including common sense knowledge from ConceptNet,
the results can include relationships not expressed in the original
data but related by common sense. See http://divisi.media.mit.edu/ for
more info.
